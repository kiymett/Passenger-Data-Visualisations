Project Abstract

I used a data set which contains US Monthly Air Passeger data between years 2000 and 2020. My project work consists of the following two steps.
- First step is about data processing and cleaning by using Python and Pandas via Jupyter Notebook.
- Second step focuses on data analysis and visualisations in Tableau. 

In my analysis, i found out that there is a significant drop in total passengers from 2019 to 2020 due to Covid situation. The other important observation in the visualisations was that in early 2000s top destinations were mainly European countries whereas in recent years Middle Eastern countries such as Qatar, United Arab Emirates surpassed these European countries and hold top positions either as destination or origin of the passengers. This is probably due to high number of transit passangers who are switching connecting flights in that destination or origin as these countries became hubs for air travel in recent years. However, there is no indication in data set whether if it is a transit flight or not.
